# Introduction

This project is based on  my last year's research project titled "Understanding Monsoon Rainfall Impacts on Roadside Slopes: A Pathway to Resilient Transport Infrastructures."  Here is brief summary about the codes run in Python program using the python libraires like Matplotlib and Pandas. 

  

## FOS
This part is mainly performed to calculate and compare avg  Factor of Safety(FoS) reduction  for different cut slopes and compared with different cut depths.  We mainly uses data of three ground slopes which is 20 pc, 30 pc and 40 pc  which again varies in cut depths 2m, 3m, 4m, 6m,8m and  cut slopes 1:05, 1:0.67, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. The excels files are the output obtain from the software GeoStudio, each sheet in excel has different soil types. 

## Report
This part is mainly performed to calculate and compare  pore pressures  for varying soil types. The graph obtain by plotting in python compares the result based on three parameters: days up to 123 days, second parameter is  pore pressure developed at three  different  cut depth 0m, 3m, 6m at two different cut section AA and BB and the third parameter is  rainfall  plotted as bar graph, and  each sheet in excel has different soil types.  The excels sheets are output of GeoStudio.

## SWCC and HCF:
This part is mainly performed to obtain soil water characteristics curve (SWCC) and Hydraulic Conductivity conductivity function(HCF). The data required for obtaining those two function .i.e. volumetric water content, negative water pressure and water X-conductivity function are extracted from various literature. The graph is obtained using the Python program and later used as input in Slope stability and Seepage analysis.
